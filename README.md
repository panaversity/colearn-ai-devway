## 🎯 Vision

**CoLearn – AI Dev Way** is a **32-chapter technical book and open specification** that redefines how we learn programming in the era of intelligent tools.
It teaches **AI-driven development** through *systematic collaboration between human learners and AI assistants*, using **Python (3.13+)** and **TypeScript** as the foundation.

The learning journey flows from fundamentals to advanced AI systems — including:

* **Agentic AI Development** with the OpenAI Agents SDK
* **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** and **FastMCP** integration
* **Spec-Kit Plus methodology** for AI-driven software design
* **Realtime and voice agents**, **containerized deployments**, and **event-driven architectures**

---

## 💡 Mission

To pioneer an **agent-native model of computer science education** where AI is:

* a **co-learner**, participating in exploration and debugging,
* a **collaborator**, shaping ideas and architectures, and
* a **creative partner**, empowering the next generation of AI developers.

## Core Philosophy

*   **AI as a Collaborative Partner:** We treat AI tools as intelligent co-workers, working together within shared constraints.
*   **Specification-First Methodology:** Clear requirements precede all work. We use the "Spec-Kit" methodology for iterative, AI-friendly development.
*   **Learning by Doing:** Every concept is practiced through realistic, AI-assisted hands-on work.
*   **Transparency:** We teach our methodology and demonstrate it throughout the book.

## Target Audience

*   **Primary:** Programming beginners with no prior coding experience.
*   **Secondary:** Professional developers transitioning to AI-driven development.

## Key Features

*   **AI-First Learning:** Learn Python with AI as a partner from day one.
*   **Modern Python:** All code uses Python 3.13+ features with mandatory type hints.
*   **Pedagogically Sound:** Content is guided by 8 specialized "co-learning skills" based on educational research.
*   **Structured and Consistent:** A project constitution and defined output styles ensure a high-quality, consistent reading experience.

### 🏷️ Naming Conventions

| Level          | Format                | Example                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Part folder    | `##-Name/`            | `02-AI-Driven-Development/`      |
| Chapter folder | `##-Chapter-Name/`    | `01-Python-Basics/`                      |
| Lesson file    | `##-Lesson-Name.md`   | `01-Getting-Started.md`                 |

---

### 📐 Docusaurus Compatibility

This structure uses **Docusaurus number prefixes** for automatic sidebar ordering.

- Each folder/file uses `##-Name` format for automatic ordering
- Docusaurus automatically removes number prefixes from URLs and titles
- Folders become sidebar categories, files become sidebar items

#### 🔗 Internal Linking

Use relative links between topics:

```md
See [Variables and Types](./02-Variables-and-Types.md) for more details.
```

---

### ✅ Book Agent Output Rules

The book-generation agent must:

1. Write Docusaurus-compatible Markdown with frontmatter
2. Follow strict numbered naming conventions (`##-Name` format)
3. Use number prefixes for automatic sidebar ordering
4. Include the 3-level hierarchy:
   - **Part folders** (`##-Part-##-Name/`)
   - **Chapter folders** (`##-Chapter-Name/`)
   - **Lesson files** (`##-Lesson-Name.md`)
5. Avoid duplicate names or invalid characters

---

### 💡 Best Practices

- Use consistent number prefixes (`01-`, `02-`, etc.) for proper ordering
- Keep folder/file names descriptive but concise
- Use hyphens instead of underscores for better URL readability
---

## 🔍 Summary

This structure supports:

- **3-level hierarchy**: Part → Chapter → Lesson
- **Automatic sidebar ordering** using Docusaurus number prefixes
- **Clean URLs** with automatic prefix removal
- **Simple file management** without complex configuration files
