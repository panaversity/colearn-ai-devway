## Prompt

Generate a plan

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Part-3 goals content following specification requirements and constitution principles.

**Plan Components Created:**

1. **Technical Context**: Defined content type, audience, complexity tier, word count, and constraints
2. **Constitution Check**: Validated alignment with 7 key principles (all PASS):
   - Principle 1: AI-First Teaching
   - Principle 5: Progressive Complexity (beginner tier)
   - Principle 8: Accessibility
   - Principle 9: Show-Spec-Validate
   - Principle 12: Cognitive Load (max 2 options, max 5 concepts)
   - Principle 13: Concept-Before-Command
   - Principles 14-15: Planning-First, Validation-Before-Trust

3. **Content Structure Breakdown** (400-600 words total):
   - Section 1: The Hook (100-120 words) - Why these skills matter
   - Section 2: What You'll Learn (150-180 words) - Ch9 & Ch10 previews
   - Section 3: Learning Path (80-100 words) - Progression and confidence
   - Section 4: Success Vision (70-100 words) - Concrete capabilities

4. **Tone & Style Guidelines**:
   - Voice: Encouraging mentor
   - Language patterns to USE/AVOID
   - Analogies for complex concepts
   - Beginner-friendly constraints

5. **Key Concepts (Max 5)**: Prompt engineering, context engineering, AI agents, validation, iteration

6. **Research Validation**: Confirmed accurate alignment with Chapter 9 and Chapter 10 content

7. **Quality Gates**: 10-point checklist for validation

8. **Implementation Notes**: Writing approach, common pitfalls, risks & mitigation

**Constitution Alignment:**
- Beginner complexity tier applied (Parts 1-3)
- Max 5 concepts constraint enforced
- Agent-native positioning maintained
- Validation-first mindset emphasized
- No jargon without context

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Complete implementation plan provides clear roadmap for writing 400-600 word Part-3 introduction; establishes quality gates and success metrics; ensures constitution alignment
- üß™ Tests: Constitution check (PASS all 7 principles), complexity tier validation (beginner), content structure validation (4 sections totaling 400-600 words)
- üìÅ Files: Created specs/009-part-3-goals/plan.md with detailed content outline, tone guidelines, quality gates, and implementation checklist
- üîÅ Next prompts: `/sp.tasks` to generate actionable task checklist; then write draft content following structure; validate against quality gates
- üß† Reflection: Successfully translated specification into detailed content plan that balances beginner accessibility with professional methodology teaching; plan provides sufficient structure to guide writing while maintaining flexibility for voice and tone

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - plan complete and constitution-aligned
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitution Check PASS (7/7 principles aligned), Content Structure PASS (sections total 400-600 words), Quality Gates PASS (10 validation criteria defined)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.plan workflow for educational content
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Write draft content and measure against word count constraint and cognitive load limits to validate plan effectiveness
