## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for Part-3 goals implementation with 42 tasks organized across 6 phases following user story priorities.

**Task Breakdown by Phase:**

1. **Phase 1 - Setup** (4 tasks): Content infrastructure preparation
   - Validate Chapter 9/10 content accessibility
   - Review preface for voice/tone alignment
   - Create Docusaurus directory structure
   - Review constitution principles

2. **Phase 2 - Foundational** (6 tasks): Content research (BLOCKS all writing)
   - Extract key topics from both chapters
   - Identify chapter relationships
   - Confirm prerequisites from Parts 1-2
   - Validate word count constraint
   - List 5 key concepts (cognitive load limit)

3. **Phase 3 - User Story 1** (6 tasks): Hook & Learning Overview (P1 - MVP)
   - Write Section 1: The Hook (100-120 words)
   - Write Section 2: What You'll Learn (150-180 words)
   - Validate word count, tone, Chapter 9/10 accuracy

4. **Phase 4 - User Story 2** (5 tasks): Learning Path & Success Vision (P2)
   - Write Section 3: Learning Path (80-100 words)
   - Write Section 4: Success Vision (70-100 words)
   - Validate word count, language patterns, Part-4 bridge

5. **Phase 5 - User Story 3** (4 tasks): Mindset Framing (P3)
   - Review all sections for agent-native language
   - Add validation emphasis throughout
   - Ensure no over-promising
   - Check for realistic framing

6. **Phase 6 - Polish** (17 tasks): Quality validation against all gates
   - Word count validation (strict 400-600)
   - Concept count validation (max 5)
   - Language validation (no ableist terms)
   - Section-by-section validation
   - Constitution compliance (5 principles)
   - Technical validation (Docusaurus build)

**Task Organization:**
- All tasks follow strict format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- User story labels applied: [US1], [US2], [US3]
- Parallel opportunities marked with [P]
- Total: 42 tasks across 6 phases

**Parallel Opportunities Identified:**
- Phase 1: T003 and T004 (infrastructure and review)
- Phase 2: T010 (concepts) parallel with research tasks
- Phase 3: T015-T016 (validation) after content complete
- Phase 4: T020-T021 (validation) after content complete
- Phase 6: Multiple validation tasks (T026-T028, T030-T033, T034-T038, T040-T042)

**Implementation Strategy:**
- MVP: Complete Phases 1-3 (US1 only) for hook and learning overview
- Incremental: Add US2 (learning path), then US3 (mindset), then polish
- Sequential recommended for voice consistency (single writer)

**Success Metrics:**
- Total task count: 42 tasks
- Tasks per user story: US1=6, US2=5, US3=4
- MVP scope: Phase 1 (4) + Phase 2 (6) + Phase 3 (6) = 16 tasks
- Parallel opportunities: 15 tasks marked [P]

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Comprehensive task list provides actionable checklist for writing 400-600 word Part-3 introduction; organized by user story for incremental delivery; includes all quality gates from plan
- üß™ Tests: Task format validation (PASS - all tasks follow required format), User story mapping (PASS - all 3 stories have phases), Constitution alignment (PASS - 5 principles checked in Phase 6)
- üìÅ Files: Created specs/009-part-3-goals/tasks.md with 42 tasks, dependencies graph, parallel execution examples, implementation strategy
- üîÅ Next prompts: Begin implementation starting with Phase 1 (Setup); execute tasks sequentially through user stories; run validation in Phase 6
- üß† Reflection: Task breakdown successfully maps specification requirements to actionable items; user story organization enables MVP-first approach (US1 only = 16 tasks); sequential execution recommended for voice consistency despite parallel opportunities

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - tasks complete and well-structured
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation PASS (all 42 tasks follow checklist format), Story mapping PASS (3 user stories mapped), Dependencies PASS (clear phase ordering)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks workflow for educational content
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute Phase 1-3 tasks and measure time to complete MVP (US1 only); validate that 250-300 words for Sections 1-2 is achievable and effective
