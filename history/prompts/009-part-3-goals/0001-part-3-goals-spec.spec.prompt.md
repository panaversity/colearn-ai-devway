## Prompt

Write goals for Part-3 which would consist of 2 chapters. Here is the context to the both chapters. @context\10_chap9_specs\ and @context\11_chap10_specs\ . Follow the links if present. The purpose of this book is to reimagine CS education so it should be:
- Beginner-friendly (no jargon without context)
- Business-focused (solving problems, not just writing code)
- Agent-native mindset (AI as collaborator for thinking and building)
- Accessible to non-developers who want to use AI to create solutions

Here is the preface of the book @context\01_preface\readme.md

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Part-3 goals covering the two-chapter sequence on Prompt Engineering (Chapter 9) and Context Engineering (Chapter 10).

**Key components created:**

1. **User Stories (Prioritized)**:
   - P1: Beginner Learns to Direct AI Agents (foundational prompting skills)
   - P2: Beginner Manages AI Agent Context (contextual awareness for multi-file projects)
   - P3: Learner Understands Agent-Native Mindset (mental model shift)

2. **Functional Requirements**: 8 requirements covering goals articulation, philosophy alignment, practical outcomes, chapter relationships, complexity tier, and misconception handling

3. **Success Criteria**: 5 measurable outcomes including prompt effectiveness (70% success rate), context management (90% consistency), mindset demonstration, confidence levels (80%), and validation-first approach

4. **Supporting Sections**:
   - Assumptions about prerequisite knowledge
   - Dependencies on Part-1 and Part-2
   - Clear scope boundaries (out of scope items)
   - Constraints (beginner-friendly, business-focused, agent-native, concise)
   - Implementation notes with tone, structure, language patterns
   - 5-point validation plan

**Alignment with book philosophy:**
- Positioned AI as co-learning partner, not replacement
- Emphasized validation-first mindset
- Focused on practical problem-solving over syntax memorization
- Maintained beginner accessibility throughout

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Specification provides clear roadmap for writing Part-3 introduction/goals section; establishes learning objectives that align with beginner-friendly, agent-native philosophy
- üß™ Tests: Specification includes 5-point validation plan (clarity, alignment, motivation, realism, constitution checks)
- üìÅ Files: Created specs/009-part-3-goals/spec.md (complete specification document)
- üîÅ Next prompts: `/sp.plan` to create detailed implementation plan for writing Part-3 goals content; `/sp.tasks` to generate task checklist
- üß† Reflection: Successfully translated chapter-level content (Chapters 9 and 10 on prompting and context engineering) into part-level learning goals that emphasize skill acquisition over knowledge accumulation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification complete and aligned with requirements
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Self-validation PASS (all mandatory sections completed, no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers, measurable success criteria defined)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate specification against actual Chapter 9 and Chapter 10 content to ensure goals accurately reflect chapter learning outcomes
