# Part 3: Working with AI Coding Agents

You've learned **about** AI-native development in Parts 1 and 2. Now it's time to **use** AI agents to build software.

This is the paradigm shift: you're no longer just writing code—you're directing intelligent agents like Claude Code and Gemini CLI to implement what you specify. The developers who thrive in this new era aren't those who type the fastest, but those who communicate most clearly with their AI partners. These two foundational skills—prompt engineering and context engineering—determine whether AI helps you build faster or slows you down with buggy, generic code.

## What You'll Learn

### Chapter 9: Prompt Engineering for AI-Driven Development

**What it is:** Prompt engineering is the skill of communicating effectively with AI coding agents to get production-quality code.

**Why it matters:** Clear prompts = working code on the first try. Vague prompts = hours spent debugging AI-generated mistakes. Studies show developers using AI agents are 55% more productive, but only when they master prompting techniques.

**How you'll learn it:** You'll practice the 8-element AIDD prompting framework—command, context, logic, roleplay, formatting, technical constraints, examples, and questions. By the end of Chapter 9, you'll construct prompts that generate code you can actually use 70% of the time.

### Chapter 10: Context Engineering for AI-Driven Development

**What it is:** Context engineering is managing what your AI agent "knows" about your project—the files, patterns, and decisions that make code fit your specific needs rather than generic tutorials.

**Why it matters:** Without good context, AI generates code that might work in isolation but breaks when integrated. With proper context management, AI maintains consistency across multiple sessions, remembers your architectural decisions, and generates code that matches your existing patterns.

**How you'll learn it:** You'll master progressive context loading (giving AI only relevant information), memory files (preserving decisions across sessions), and context compression (keeping long conversations focused). You'll work on multi-file projects where code generated in Session 2 automatically follows patterns established in Session 1.

**The connection:** Prompting is **what you SAY** to your AI agent. Context is **what your AI agent KNOWS** when you say it. Together, they form your complete AI collaboration skillset.

## Your Learning Path

You'll start simple: basic prompts for single-function tasks. Then you'll add technical constraints and examples to get project-specific code. Next, you'll learn to manage context across multi-file projects, ensuring consistency when you return to work days later. Finally, you'll master AI orchestration—directing your AI partner through complex, multi-session development workflows.

No programming experience required. You're not memorizing syntax. You're learning to think with AI—to express intent clearly and manage information effectively. The AI handles the typing; you understand the concepts and validate the results.

## What You'll Be Able to Do

After completing Part-3, you will:

1. **Construct effective prompts** that generate working code on first attempt
2. **Manage AI agent context** across multi-day projects for consistency
3. **Iterate intelligently** with AI to refine specifications and improve code
4. **Validate AI-generated code** for correctness, security, and project fit
5. **Think like an orchestrator** who designs systems and directs AI implementation

From here on, every chapter in this book uses AI collaboration as the default workflow. You'll apply these skills to learn Python (Part 4), build real applications, and eventually deploy production-ready agentic systems.

The shift starts now: from passive reader to active AI orchestrator.
